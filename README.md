# Overview

I wanted to get some experience in a new language so I decided to make a character builder in Kotlin. This program uses the Point-Buy system of creating a character for the Dungeons and Dragons 5E roleplaying game.
The user is able to pick a name and race for their character. The race determines bonuses to the ability scores applied at the end. The point buy system uses a bank to let the user increase
or decrease score values. The program performs the appropriate math informing the user if they've exceeded any boundaries. I have a lot of interest in tabletop games and I find it is really helpful for new players when
they can work with a computer to help them understand the creation process and automate a lot of the math involved.

# Development Environment
I used the IntelliJ program to code in Kotlin.

# Future Work
- Add in all standard 5E races with their applicable bonuses
- Adjust the stat change functions to allow a user to input a desired result and the program performs all the math instead of increasing one at a time
- Add a Save/Load utility so characters can be saved in a file and reused and modified.
